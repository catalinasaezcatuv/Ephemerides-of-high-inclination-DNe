# Ephemerides-of-high-inclination-DNe
Ephemerides of high-inclination DNe with new orbital periods based on Gaia Alerts photometry

Individual Gaia Alerts eclipse epochs, used for the calculation of the ehpemeris data in Tables A0 and A1, arranged according to the right ascencion (the first 6 digits). N is the total number of eclipse observations per target. E is the cycle number, HJD is the Heliocentric Julian Date, after subsctracion of 2450000.
